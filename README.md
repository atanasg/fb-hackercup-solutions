# fb-hackercup-solutions
Own solutions for the annual Facebook Hacker Cup competition. Visit
https://www.facebook.com/codingcompetitions/hacker-cup for more details.

*NOTE:* The solutions are being pushed to this repository always after the end of the corresponding
competition round. This should prevent any cheating attempts. The goal is rather to share knowledge
and exchange algorithmic ideas.
